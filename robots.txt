# If you moved any of following directories within a folder such as at
# e.g. www.example.com/site/ the robots.txt file MUST be
# moved to the site root at e.g. www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the site folder name MUST be prefixed to the disallowed
# path, e.g. the Disallow rule for the /cmf/ folder
# MUST be changed to read Disallow: /site/cmf/

# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/
# http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html

User-agent: *
Disallow: /cmf/
Disallow: /cms/

# You can also move `cmf` and `cms` folders to an upper folder
# than root folder, So just edit `index.php` file and correct related path
# In this way you don't need to put `robots.txt` in the root, Because Search Engines
# Can't accesss to the folders upper than root folder like public_html
